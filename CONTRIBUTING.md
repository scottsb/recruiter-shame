# Contributing to the Recruitment Agency Hall of Shame

## Submitting a new shame report

**Means:** Pull Request

If you would like to add an agency to the list, please submit a pull
request adding them directly to the list. In the commit message indicate
which specific criteria from the [README](README.md) were violated.

## Requesting removal of an agency

**Means:** Issue

If you would like to see your agency removed from the list, please open
an issue describing the misunderstanding that led to your inclusion
or the specific steps you have taken to resolve the issue.

I will aim to give the benefit of the doubt in any cases presented, but
any outright demands for removal without justification will be closed.
Before any agency is removed, I will provide a chance for comment by
the original contributor who submitted your agency.

## Proposing a policy change

**Means:** Issue or Pull Request

If you would like to see a change to any policy described here or in the
[README](README.md), please open an issue describing the change you'd like
to see so it can be discussed. If it's a trivial or very concrete change,
a pull request is also acceptable.
