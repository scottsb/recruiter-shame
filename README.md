# Recruitment Agency Hall of Shame

Access the lists here:
* [Agencies Shamefully Recruiting Candidates](shame-recruiting.md)
* [Agencies Shamefully Selling to Companies](shame-sales.md)

## Background & introduction

Every tech employee has recruiter horror stories to tell: recruiters who don't
pay attention to qualification matches, who misrepresent positions, etc. Less
commonly circulated are the horror stories of how recruitment agencies attempt
to sell their services to companies with open positions.

Unfortunately, despite just how bad some of these actors are, they stay in
business, partly because business is done at a distance, so each party doesn't
know how the other party is being treated. This has the effect of tarnishing
the entire recruitment industry's reputation, which is unfortunate, as these
agencies can be truly valuable parts of the employment ecosystem.

The goal of this project is to publicly identify the bad actors so that
hopefully they can be avoided.

## What these lists will include

* **Only agencies, not employers.** While in-house recruiters can commit the
  same offenses, the goal is here is to be a warning to companie looking to
  work with an outside agency.
* **Only agencies, not individuals.** It is an agency's responsibility to train
  its employees on what approaches are acceptable, and a recruiter does his/er
  job in the name of his/her employer.
* **Only agencies based corporately in the United States.** This may change at
  some point but will help limit the initial scope.

## How to get onto the lists

For the sake of consistency and objectivity, there are specific criteria for
getting a spot on the lists. These criteria may evolve over time; suggestions
for changes can be opened as issues on this repository.

There will be extenuating circumstances where violating any of the criteria
is not offensive, but in these situations the reasoning needs to be clearly
communicated in the message and pass the "reasonable person" test.

Anybody can submit an agency based on personal experience. See the
[Contribution Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more detail.

### Candidate recruiting criteria of shame

1. Contacting a prospect again after being directly requested not to.
2. Contacting a prospect through a means of communication that the prospect
   requested not to be used (e.g., phone).
3. Contacting a prospect about a clearly irrelevant position. A position is
   irrelevant if:
   * It mandates significant areas of skill that the prospect does not possess
     (e.g., recruiting an engineer who has only used Ruby for a position that
     explicitly requires Java experience). 
   * It is at least two typical career levels off from any position the
     candidate has ever held (e.g., recruiting a senior architect as a
     mid-level developer). 

### Recruitment sales criteria of shame

1. Contacting a company after being directly requested not to.
2. Contacting a company through a means of communication that the company
   requested not to be used (e.g., phone).
3. Continuing to pitch services after being politely declined.

## How to get off of the lists

Misunderstandings are possible, and agencies may change their ways. If
your agency is listed here and wish to be removed, raise an issue making
your case. See the [Contribution Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more detail.

## Related projects

While this project independently conceived, others have also had similar
ideas. Some of these accept community contributions, but I believe that
using the GitHub repository format allows more open participation.
